# DSA with C programming language

### **About**
*Data Structure and Algorithm with C*

This repository has an implementation of the algorithms and data structures in the C programming language. I made this repository for fun, and it started while I was solving the *programming and data-structure* challenges lessons in university. I thought it would be helpful for others, especially students, and some more study for myself.
